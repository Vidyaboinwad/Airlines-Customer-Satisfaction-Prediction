📌 Project Overview
Customer satisfaction is a key factor in the airline industry.
Dissatisfied passengers may choose competitors, leading to revenue loss. This project analyzes airline customer data to predict passenger satisfaction based on multiple factors, such as flight class, service quality, delays, and in-flight amenities.


🔍 Objective:

Predict customer satisfaction levels based on given features.
Identify key factors influencing passenger experience to improve airline services.
Develop machine learning models to classify satisfied vs. unsatisfied passengers.


🛠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Models: Decision Trees, SVM, Random Forest


🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Preprocessing

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Outlier detection using boxplots and statistical methods.
Feature encoding for categorical variables (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
Data visualization using histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
Identified trends in passenger satisfaction (e.g., premium class passengers are more satisfied).

🤖 Model Building & Evaluation

✅ Supervised Learning Models Used:
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy Score: Measures how well the model classifies passengers correctly.
Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall for overall performance assessment.
AUC-ROC Curve: Evaluates model’s classification ability across different thresholds.

📌 Key Insights & Business Recommendations

📢 Based on the data analysis and model results, the following insights were found:

Passengers with longer flight delays are more likely to be dissatisfied.

Business-class travelers have significantly higher satisfaction rates than economy passengers.
Service quality (food, entertainment, staff behavior) plays a crucial role in passenger satisfaction.
Frequent travelers (loyalty program members) tend to give higher satisfaction ratings.
✅ Recommendations for Airlines:

Improve on-time performance to reduce flight delays.
Enhance in-flight services for economy passengers.
Offer personalized rewards for frequent travelers to improve loyalty.
